## Classification of Images (CIFAR-10) using CNNs
### Problem Statement
- The dataset stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR)
- CIFAR-10 is widely used for machine learning and computer vision applications. 
- The dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images and 6,000 images of each class.
- Images have low resolution (32x32). 
- CIFAR-10 is a dataset that consists of several images divided into the following 10 classes: 
    - Airplanes
    - Cars 
    - Birds
    - Cats
    - Deer
    - Dogs
    - Frogs
    - Horses
    - Ships
    - Trucks

**The following steps are followed for the Classification:**
- Step 1: Import Libraries and datasets
- Step 2: Visualize Dataset
- Step 3: Data Preparation
- Step 4: Train the model
- Step 5: Model Evaluation
- Step 6: Saving the model
- Step 7: Model training using Augmented CIFAR-10 dataset
